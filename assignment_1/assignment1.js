Exercise #1
Initialize an empty array below in the variable numbers.

Exercise #2
Using the loop provided for you below, use an array's push method to insert the nummbers  0 to 10 into positions 0 through 10 of the numbers array you just initialized above.'If you're not sure how to use the array push method go back and re read this module on data strucutres.'

Exercise #3
Test that you used the array push method correctly by printing the sum of the values at position 3 and 6 of the array (use the console.log() function to print to the console). 
The outputted value should be 9.

Use the console.log() function and the array .pop() to add all the values in the array.
